# UnderTheWire

UnderTheWire is a platform with challenges to learn Powershell. How does it work? You can connect to their server with ssh and the objective is to retrieve the password to have acces to the next challenge just like a CTF. In here, the answers are gonna be encrypted with gpg so no one is getting spoiled.
